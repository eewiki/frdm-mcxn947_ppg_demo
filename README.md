# Overview

This demo project shows how to obtain a photoplethysmogram (PPG) from a MAX86916 bio-sensor from Analog Devices. It features three development boards, the base of which is the FRDM-MCXN947 utilizing the MCX N947 MCU from NXP. This MCU includes a DSP co-processor which is utilized to efficiently filter the very low frequency components (i.e., DC offset and baseline wander) from the PPG signal. The Heart Rate 10 Click board from MikroElectronika provides a straightforward interface to the optical sensor and the LCD-PAR-S035 board from NXP is used to display the GUI.
